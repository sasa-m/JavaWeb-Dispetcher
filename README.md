This is a small application that shows how the servlet Dispatcher works.
The parameters are entered in the browser URL and the corresponding JSP page is opened based on that.
The desired page and controller are entered in the URL as follows:
    http://localhost:8080/dispecer/mydispetcher?page=help&cont=User
    http://localhost:8080/dispecer/mydispetcher?page=details&cont=Admin
    http://localhost:8080/dispecer/mydispetcher?page=help&cont=Admin
